# Goals
- demonstrate SSR with `getServerSideProps` in a simple to understand way
    - SSR is great for data fetching at the page/view level and avoids making unnecessary http requests
- demonstrate `useSWR` and `useSWRMutation` for client side data fetching
    - client side data fetching is great for data fetching at the component level
    - client side data fetching is necessary if we want to fetch/mutate data upon user input/interaction such as submitting a form or clicking a button

# Tech used
- next.js for framework
- sqlite for db
- sequelize for orm
- iron-session for session
# TODO
- refactor server services/api endpoints, definitely could be cleaner
